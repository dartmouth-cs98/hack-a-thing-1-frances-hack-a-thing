###Hackathon 1
###CS 98 Fall 2019

## What I did
Having never worked with React Native before, I found several tutorials online and did my best to follow them to create some Ios applications. The three applications I attempted to build were: a simple to-do list, a chat application using firebase to store messages/users, and a google maps application (which I was not able to get fully functioning).

## What I learned
I was able to apply a lot of my react/redux skills from CS 52, while also learning a lot of the specifics of react-native. I found the development process to be a lot more challenging than I expected. The simulator was difficult to use and the error statements were often extremely vague. I also had a lot of challenges relating to version compatibilities for different packages, since the tutorials I was following had much older versions of react-native, redux, etc. and I had to make sure all the dependencies worked together. I found a lot of help online by searching for the errors I was getting and finding that many of them were very common and had easy but somewhat arbitrary fixes (for example, downgrading or upgrading a package to a specific version number).

## What didn't work
I was not able to get the google maps integration working. I was having an issue with Air Google Maps, which seemed to be missing certain files and I'm not sure if it may have had to do with the versions of the packages I was working with. I spent many hours debugging, and learned a lot about react-native development tools while working with this application, even though I was not able to get a final product.
